                hey, i'm Ademola Olutomiwa, I am a javascript developer.
                with the help of javascript and the technology built around it,
                i help to make good looking user friendly and easily navigatable
                website.

                <p>
                    My name is Tomiwa and im a graduate of physics,
                    i fell in love with javascript and the web after 
                    seeing a developer coded the purple rain on youtube back in 2017.
                    After I graduated in 2018, I was so curious and wanted to make my
                    computer rain any color of my choice. So I decided to learn the language the guy used in the 
                    video. After that I decided to learn the technology that would help make my 
                    my computer rain the color of my choice which are html, css and javascript.
                    After a long while of studying and practicing, I finally developed my own version 
                    of the 'purple rain' which I call colorful rain/ rain of rainbows. Its 
                    a webapp that rains rain of varities of color. to view click <a href='colorful rain'>here</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    after performing first task coding the colorful rain, the passion i had for the 
                    web soared astronomically that i couldnt stop at just html, css and javaScript...
                    i fell i love with the web and decided to make a carier out of it. so i processed
                    learning other technologies around the web to be not just an hobbist programmer
                    but also a professional one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After building the colorful rain app, since then i cant just stop building.
                    Its something i enjoy and would want to spend all my time doing expect sometimes
                    when i hit some really though bugs ;)  . Generally, im a very curious and creative individual that
                    would not give up until the code works perfectly and efficiently
                </p>

                <p>
